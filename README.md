# Hashlife

Hashlife is an authentication, encryption, and authorization protocol especially for mobile devices.  It can be used to select intended recipients of files on a mobile device, transferring an encrypted file, and uniquely allowing the recipient to decipher the file using public, private, and randomly generated keys.  Hashlife mirrors the PGP protocol but adds extra functionality including text-message based authentication. The greatest advantage is the fact that the Hashlife server only stores public keys and never encounters actual file data, so it is immune to unauthorized intrusions.
